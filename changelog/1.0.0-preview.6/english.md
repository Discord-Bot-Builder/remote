## **Dynamic Block**

**Opening up new possibilities for Block Developers**
<br>

Block Developers can now program the blocks to perform dynamic actions with limitless and unimaginable possibilities. Be aware that such capabilities may impact performance if used excessively.<br>
<br>
For Block Developers: check out [dynamic_block_test.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Discord-Bot-Builder/Blocks/8cea95fafaf85aaed8f24c6ee70c9ab390b64134/templates/dynamic_block_test.js) to find out how to make a dynamic block.

## **Worth Mentioning**

-   **Built-In Bot Terminal**, so the users don't need to install Node.js on their computers. This feature can be reversed in the app settings to use an external terminal.
-   **Keybinds**, it's a new settings page to allow you to set up custom keyboard shortcuts for various actions.
-   **Customizable Project Info**, it's now possible to rename projects and change their icons by right-clicking on them.
-   **Lock/Unlock Items & Enable/Disable Blocks**, you can block Blocks from working or from changing their properties (moving, resizing, etc...).
-   **Searchable Block Dropdowns**, when opening a dropdown menu from a block, the user can type to search for the menu option now.
