### **Hey Builders!**

This update is about a substantial user interface change, the result of weeks of constant work and research. You will notice that there is a lot of work on the small details.<br>
Initially, I thought I wouldn't need to make any more changes to the user interface for a while, but, in fact, there were many things to implement yet and more in the future.

## **New Redesign**

**A more intuitive, flexible and robust user interface**
<br>

Now the user is less dependent on the application menu, making it easier to use and more versatile for adding new features, such as the new _App Settings_, located in the bottom left corner. There is more to discover...

## **Workspace Tabs & Multiproject**

**Be more multitasking**  
<br>

Open more workspace and project in the same window and organize them however you want. You need to enable "Workspace Tabs" in the _App Settings_.

## **Workspace Edges**

**~~_help me stepbro, i'm stuck_~~**
<br>

Drag anything to the edges of the workspace window to move the workspace, making it more accessible.
<br>
<br>
<br>

### **Tips**

-   Press Ctrl+Tab to switch to the previous workspace tab
-   Middle-click any Project, Block, Note, Wire, Workspace or Workspace Tab to delete it
-   When dragging a new Wire, right-click over a port instead of releasing the left mouse button, to continue making more connections
